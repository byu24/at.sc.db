```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

The following steps outline how to analyze the digital expression matrices (DGE) for Arabidopsis Thalinia single-cell RNAseq data.

Load the following libraries:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("Seurat")
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
```

## Including Plots (EXAMPLE)

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
